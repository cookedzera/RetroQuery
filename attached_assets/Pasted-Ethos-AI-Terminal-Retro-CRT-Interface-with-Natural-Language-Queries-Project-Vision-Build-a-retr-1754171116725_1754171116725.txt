Ethos AI Terminal - Retro CRT Interface with Natural Language Queries
🎯 Project Vision
Build a retro CRT terminal interface where users can ask natural language questions about Ethos Network data and get AI-powered responses. Think "1980s computer terminal meets modern AI assistant" for Web3 reputation lookups.
🖥️ Core User Experience
Users type natural questions like:

"What was my weekly reward?"
"How much XP did @vitalik earn this month?"
"Compare my attestations with @dwr"
"Who gave me the most positive reviews?"
"What's my reputation score trend?"

The AI interprets, fetches real Ethos data via API, and responds in authentic retro terminal style.
